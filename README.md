# Countdown Timer

This is a simple countdown timer application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows the user to set a specific time duration and counts down until the time is up.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or copy the code into your local environment.
2. Install the required dependencies, if not already installed.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

```bash
python countdown_timer.py
```

## Usage

1. Upon running the script, a window will appear with a title "Time Counter" and an input field for hours, minutes, and seconds.
2. Enter the desired time duration in the corresponding input fields.
3. Click the "Set Time Countdown" button to start the countdown.
4. The countdown will begin, and the remaining time will be displayed in the input fields, updating every second.
5. When the time reaches zero, a messagebox will pop up with the message "Time's up".

**Note**: Ensure that you input valid numeric values for hours, minutes, and seconds. Invalid inputs will display an error message in the console.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the countdown timer:

1. Set the countdown time to 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 0 seconds.
2. Click the "Set Time Countdown" button.
3. The countdown will begin, and the input fields will display the remaining time.
4. After 1 hour and 30 minutes, the messagebox will pop up with the message "Time's up".
